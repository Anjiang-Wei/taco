cannonMM: /scratch2/anjiang/taco/deps/legion/runtime/mappers/default_mapper.cc:2422: void Legion::Mapping::DefaultMapper::default_report_failed_instance_creation(const Legion::Task&, unsigned int, Legion::Processor, Legion::Memory, size_t) const: Assertion `false' failed.
[1 - 7f0aec095000]    2.380472 {5}{default_mapper}: Default mapper failed allocation of size 268435456 bytes for region  requirement 0 of task taco_fill (UID 89) in memory 1e00010000000000 (SYSTEM_MEM) for processor 1d00010000000002 (OMP_PROC). This means the working set of your application is too big for the allotted capacity of the given memory under the default mapper's mapping scheme. You have three choices: ask Realm to allocate more memory, write a custom mapper to better manage working sets, or find a bigger machine.
